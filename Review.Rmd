When I ran all the code everything ran smoothly and I didn't encounter any real errors.

I think your work flow makes sense and you get the files that are needed. I think using the merge command is nice and saves some line of code. 

I did run into some trouble when I ran some of your visualization code. 
Lines 226-228. I think the output got changed and I'm not able to visualize the code. 

I think you did a great job and I don't have much to say. If you get the visualization portion figured out I'll be happy to look at it!
